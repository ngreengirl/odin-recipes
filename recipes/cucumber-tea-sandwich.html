    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul> 
        <li> 1 large English cucumber (about 1 lb.), thinly sliced</li> 
        <li> 1/2 tsp. kosher salt </li>
        <li> 1 (8-oz.) pkg. cream cheese, softened </li>
        <li> 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise </li>
        <li> 1 tsp. lemon zest </li>
        <li> 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh dill </li>
        <li> 2 Tbsp. chopped chives </li>
        <li> 8 slices firm sandwich bread (such as Pepperidge Farm) </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a medium bowl, toss the cucumber slices with salt. Be sure the cucumber slices are thoroughly coated.
            Spread the cucumber slices in an even layer on the kitchen towel. 
            Roll it up and let stand to absorb the moisture from the cucumber slices while you prepare the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li> In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese, mayonnaise and lemon zest until smoothly combined.
            Stir in the dill and chives.
        </li>
        <li>Place four slices of bread on a cutting board and spread about 1/4 cup of cream cheese mixture on each.
            Unroll the towel with the cucumber slices and divide them between the four slices of bread, placing them evenly on the cream cheese.
            Place the remaining four slices of bread on top to make sandwiches, pressing down lightly.
        </li>
        <li>If desired, slice off the crusts, then cut in half in triangles, or into four "fingers." Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 4 hours.</li>
    </ol>
