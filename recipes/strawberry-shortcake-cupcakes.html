    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul> 
        <li> 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus 2 tablespoons</li> 
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li> 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature </li>
        <li> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar </li>
        <li> 4 large eggs, room temperature        </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 6 tablespoons sour cream, room temperature </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons good-quality strawberry jam </li>
        <li> 12 ounces strawberries, finely chopped, plus more thinly sliced, for topping </li>
        <li> Lightly sweetened whipped cream, for topping </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners. Whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.
             Cream butter and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 8 minutes. 
             Add eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly between each addition, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in vanilla. 
             Reduce speed to low; add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with sour cream and beating until just incorporated.</li>
        <li> Divide batter evenly among the tins using a 1/4 cup measure or ice cream scoop. 
            Tap pans and smooth tops with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. 
            Bake until a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 30 minutes. 
            Let cool on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk the jam in a small bowl until smooth. Fold in chopped strawberries.
             Using a melon baller or teaspoon, scoop out a hole in the center of each cupcake. 
             Fill with 1 to 2 teaspoons strawberry filling. Top with whipped cream and a slice of strawberry.
              Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
